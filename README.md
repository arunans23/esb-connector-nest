### Nest ESB Connector

The Nest connector allows you to access the Nest API through the WSO2 ESB. Nest API is a real-time data API, offering subscription based access to data shared by Nest devices. It allows the user to control the devices in home but more than just on/off the devices, it makes the house more thoughtful one. This API servers use Firebase protocols to communicate with Nest in real-time.
